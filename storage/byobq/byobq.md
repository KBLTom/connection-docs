        - Click on the **Manage** link.

[**Learn more**](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#create_a_new_bucket)

1.	Navigate to **Cloud Storage > Buckets**. Click **Create Bucket**.
2.	**Name the bucket**, e.g., “keboola-yourorganization-files”. The bucket name must be globally unique, so choose a custom name.
3.	**Choose the region** where your data will be stored. <br/>**Important**: The bucket must be set in the same region as the product bought through the marketplace. For example, if you buy a Keboola EU product, select the EU region; otherwise, the registration of the BigQuery backend in Keboola will be rejected.
4.	Set **other options** as desired. We recommend checking _Enforce public access prevention on this bucket_. Click **Create**.
5.	Once the bucket is created, select the **Lifecycle** tab and click **Add rule**.

    - Under **Select object condition > Set rule scopes**, select **Object Name Matches Prefix** and set the prefix to `exp-2/`.
    - Under **Select object condition > Set conditions**, select `Age`. Set the age to `2 days`and click **Create**.
    - Repeat the previous steps for the prefix `exp-15/` with an age of `15 days`.
6.	Select the **Permissions** tab and click **Grant access**.
    - Paste the principal email address of the service account created earlier.
    - Under **Select a role**, choose **Cloud Storage > Storage Object Admin** and click **Save**.

***Note:** If you want to see your BigQuery tables directly in the BigQuery console, go to your folder and add a BigQuery Data Viewer or higher role.*
